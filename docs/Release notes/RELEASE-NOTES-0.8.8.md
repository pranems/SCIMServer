# SCIMServer v0.8.8 – Keepalive Noise Reduction

## Highlights
- **Suppress Entra keepalive chatter** – Raw Logs view now auto-hides recurring `userName eq <GUID>` pings, with a per-user toggle and banner telling you what was filtered.
- **Activity feed parity** – The human-readable dashboard shares the same toggle, keeps badge counts honest, and ignores keepalive traffic in the summary cards.
- **Shared detection helper** – Keepalive identification now lives in a single utility used by both backend and frontend so we do not regress when Entra tweaks its polling cadence.
